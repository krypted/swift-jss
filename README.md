This project aims to offer simple, elegant, swift access to the Jamf Casper JSS API. It is built based on the python-jss API from Shea Craig, available at https://github.com/sheagcraig/python-jss.

The Casper Suite provides access to the JSS and most of its object types through a REST API. swift-jss allows you interact with the API to create new objects, list or edit the existing ones, and to upload files to configured distribution points using Swift.

As with python-jjs, the level of coverage for convenience methods and properties is primarily centered on Computer management, and specifically, those aspects which factor into policy and package management.
